Pedestrian intention prediction (PIP) is crucial for autonomous driving systems navigating complex urban environments. Existing PIP methods usually explore each pedestrian individually. However, we notice that human behavior is highly influenced by social context. Especially, a pedestrian in group may tend to act in accordance with the group.We constructed a novel dataset (PIE-Group) built upon the PIE dataset by annotating group positions, semantics, intentions, and tracks. The new datasets consists of 450 extra cases of group behaviors. Metrics quantifying group dynamics' influence on pedestrian behavior were proposed, revealing that incorporating group intentions helps boost prediction accuracy. This study underscores the importance of social context in autonomous driving, providing essential data for developing more socially aware and efficient autonomous vehicles.

You can read all annotation information in the dataset using the get_info script. The script translate can be used to convert the annotated Chinese semantic information into English.
